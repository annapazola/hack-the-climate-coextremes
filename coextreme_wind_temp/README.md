# Co-dependence of climate extreme under CC

## General
The present code is used to estimate the co-dependence of climate variables.
We study the event: 'occurrence of high wind conditional to extreme low temperature'.


## Metric
The measure of co-dependence Chi is defined in (Dependence Measures for Extreme Value Analyses-Coles et al.,2000).
Chi represents the conditional probability of simultaneous extremes.


## Results
We assess the variability of Chi under different future projections period [2020,2030] and [2050,2060] for the RCP8.5.

The results illustrtate the variation of Chi for 4 locations for the wind variable, that correspond to locations of onshore wind farms in the UK:
- Kent, England: (50,0)
- Devon, England: (50,4),
- Tappaghan Mountain, Ireland: (54,7)
- Hill of Eastertown, Scotland: (57,2)
